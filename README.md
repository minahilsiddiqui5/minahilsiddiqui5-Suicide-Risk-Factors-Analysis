# Suicide-Risk-Factors-Analysis

Suicide rates differ globally, with notable high rates in regions like Southern Africa and Eastern Europe, where the numbers exceed 15 annual deaths per 100,000 individuals. Through the analysis of this dataset, key insights have been uncovered in the following areas:

- Global Mean Age-Standardized Suicide Rate Over Time
- Regional Suicide Rates
- Top 5 Countries with the Highest Suicide Rates
- Top 5 Countries with the Lowest Suicide Rates

These insights aim to provide a detailed perspective on the global and regional patterns of suicide rates, identifying areas with critical levels of suicide occurrences.
